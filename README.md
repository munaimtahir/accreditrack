# AccrediTrack

AccrediTrack is an accreditation management portal for medical colleges and teaching hospitals.

It lets you:
- Define accreditation proformas (templates with sections and items).
- Assign them to departments.
- Track completion, upload evidence, and exchange comments.
- See dashboards with completion analytics for each proforma and department.

This repo is scaffolded as an **AI‑developer friendly** monorepo:

- `backend/` – Django + DRF API.
- `frontend/` – Next.js + TypeScript UI.
- `infra/` – Docker, docker‑compose, and deployment helpers.
- `docs/` – Design and architecture documents.
- `.github/` – CI and issue templates.

## Getting Started

- See `docs/SETUP.md` to get started locally.
- See `CI-CD.md` for CI/CD workflows and testing procedures.
